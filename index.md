I am an iOS Developer who is driven by a passion for UX design and problem solving.  I strive to make user experiences that are both intuitive and enjoyable, while making sure to design them in a way that makes changes intuitive to implement.  My main goal right now is to master Soroush Khanlou's coordinator pattern.
